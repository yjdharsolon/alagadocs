# App Flow Document for AlagaDocs

## Introduction

AlagaDocs is an AI-powered platform that helps healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses, and transcriptionists quickly create accurate medical documentation. The app turns recorded audio or directly recorded voice into structured medical notes that include key sections such as Chief Complaint, History of Present Illness, and Assessment & Plan. The primary goal is to reduce the time spent on manual documentation and improve the accuracy of patient records, all while complying with important privacy and security standards like HIPAA.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first accesses AlagaDocs, they are greeted with a clean landing page designed to explain the benefits of the platform in simple terms. New users can create an account using their email or by opting in with social logins such as Google or Facebook. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email and is prompted to set up basic profile details. If a returning user forgets their password, a simple 'Forgot Password' option allows them to trigger a reset process. All these steps ensure that users get smoothly onboarded and can start leveraging the core functionalities immediately.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once the user logs in, they land on a straightforward dashboard that serves as the central hub for all activities. The dashboard features a clear header that displays the userâ€™s name and profile picture, a sidebar that provides quick links to the main sections, and widgets that offer recent activity and notifications. The interface shows prominent options such as role selection, audio upload or recording, and access to editing tools. This dashboard is connected to all core features, making it easy for users to switch between actions and maintain a seamless workflow.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

After logging in, the first action for the user is often to select their professional role, whether they are a doctor, nurse, or transcriptionist. This selection tailors the subsequent pages to display personalized text structuring options, ensuring that all transcription outputs meet specific needs. The next page is dedicated to audio upload and voice recording. On this page, users can either select an audio file (supporting formats such as MP3 and WAV) or record voice directly using the built-in recording feature. Once the audio is submitted, the system directs the user to an AI Transcription page where the voice is converted into text with special attention to medical terms.

Following transcription, the user is taken to a structured output page where the text is organized into a preset medical note format. If the default format does not suit their needs, users have the option to customize the format on a separate screen dedicated to text structuring. From here, users may transition to the real-time editing page where they can make manual changes to ensure the accuracy of the transcript. Once satisfied, they can move to a copy-to-EMR feature page that simplifies the process of copying the formatted text for use in their existing medical record systems. If users want to verify transcription effectiveness or provide feedback, they can navigate to a ratings page. Additionally, if users are accessing premium features or advanced functionality, they will be guided to a secure billing page that supports various regional payment methods.

## Settings and Account Management

The account management section is designed to let users easily update their personal information, change their saved text structuring templates, and configure notification settings. On the profile page, users can manage their account details and review past transcriptions. If billing or subscription preferences need updating, the user is redirected to the payment settings module where they can choose from options like subscriptions or pay-per-use models. Once the settings are adjusted, users can quickly return to the main dashboard to continue with their tasks, ensuring a cohesive and uninterrupted experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the application, careful attention is given to handling errors and alternative user paths. If a user enters invalid data during sign-up or while updating their custom text structure, clear and concise error messages appear that explain what went wrong and how to correct it. If the AI transcription faces issues such as high load or connectivity problems, the system displays fallback messages and instructions for retesting the upload. In addition, if there is a problem during audio upload or recording, users are given visual cues and the option to try again without losing any progress. These error states are built into every page, ensuring that any disruption in the flow can be quickly resolved with minimal frustration.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The complete journey through AlagaDocs starts with simple account creation and a clear onboarding process. Users then move effortlessly to role selection, where the app customizes the interface to their needs. With an easy-to-use dashboard as the central hub, users can upload or record audio, have the content transcribed automatically with special attention to medical terminologies, and see the text neatly formatted into structured notes. The platform offers the flexibility to adjust formatting, edit transcripts in real time, and copy the notes for use in EMR systems. With integrated settings, billing management, and robust error handling built into every step, AlagaDocs presents a fully connected and user-friendly experience designed to simplify medical documentation while ensuring compliance and security throughout the process.
