Here's the **final refined version** of your **"Workflow"** document, incorporating your update that after the end of a consultation, the app should return to the **Select Patient** page.

# **AlagaDocs Workflow**

## **1. User Authentication & Role Selection**
- **Login:** Users must log in to access the system.  
- **Select Role:** The user selects their role (Doctor, Nurse, etc.). *(All roles have equal access control.)*  

## **2. Patient Management**
- **Patient Search:** Before starting a consultation, the user searches for an existing patient.  
  - If the patient exists â†’ Select patient profile and proceed.  
  - If the patient is new â†’ Register a new patient.  
- **Patient Registration (For New Patients):**  
  - Full Name  
  - Birthdate  
  - **Auto-computed Age** (based on birthdate and current date)  
  - Contact Information  
- **Patient Access Restriction:**  
  - Each patient record is **only accessible to the doctor who registered them**. Other doctors cannot view or edit these records.  

## **3. Consultation & Transcription Process**
- **Start Consultation:** After selecting or registering a patient, the consultation begins.  
- **Voice Recording / Manual Input:**  
  - If using voice recording, the **file name should be the patientâ€™s full name**.  
  - If manually typing, the user inputs notes directly.  
- **Transcription:** Converts recorded audio into text.  
- **Text Structuring:** The system organizes the transcription into a structured format.  

## **4. Document Processing & Storage**
- **Template Generation:** Converts structured text into predefined medical templates.  
- **Review Before Saving:**  
  - Users **must review and confirm** that all data is correct before saving.  
  - **Edits are not allowed after saving.**  
- **Save & Export Options:**  
  - **Save within the app** (under the patientâ€™s profile).  
  - **Copy to EMR** (for direct pasting).  
  - **Export as PDF** (with AlagaDocs branding, patient details, and timestamp).  

## **5. Patient Records & Follow-Up**
- **All interactions are stored under the patientâ€™s profile.**  
- **Next consultations:**  
  - If the patient returns, the doctor can access past notes and continue from previous records, eliminating the need for re-registration.  

## **6. Audit & Security**
- **Audit Log:**  
  - The system tracks **who accessed or modified a patientâ€™s records**.  
  - Logs include timestamps and user actions.  

## **7. General Workflow Summary**
1. **Login**  
2. **Select Role**  
3. **Search for Patient**  
   - If patient exists â†’ Select  
   - If new â†’ Register  
4. **Start Consultation**  
5. **Voice Recording / Manual Typing**  
6. **Transcribe**  
7. **Text Structuring**  
8. **Template Generation**  
9. **Review & Confirm Data** *(No edits allowed after saving.)*  
10. **Save / Copy / Export to PDF**  
11. **End Consultation** â†’ Automatically return to Select Patient Page*

### **Final Confirmation**
âœ… The app will return to the **Select Patient** page immediately after the consultation ends.  
âœ… No edits are allowed after saving, so users must confirm data before saving.  
âœ… Patients are only accessible to the doctor who registered them.  
âœ… Audit logs will track all access and modifications.  

Let me know if this is **final** or if you have any last tweaks! ðŸš€
