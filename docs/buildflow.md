Implementation Approach:
Based on the implementation plan, I would tackle this in phases:

Phase 1: Set up environment and project structure
Phase 2: Develop backend API endpoints for authentication, audio upload, transcription, text structuring
Phase 3: Create frontend pages and components for all features
Phase 4: Integrate frontend with backend services
Phase 5: Deploy and test
Current Assessment:
I understand the project requirements and flow. Since you asked me not to code yet, I'll wait for your approval on how to proceed.

My Proposed Next Steps:
Review current project structure to understand what's already implemented
Create a detailed plan for implementing each feature, starting with core functionality
Implement features one by one, starting with user authentication and role selection
Build out the audio upload and transcription functionality
Add the remaining features (structuring, editing, copying, billing)
Apply final styling and ensure mobile responsiveness
