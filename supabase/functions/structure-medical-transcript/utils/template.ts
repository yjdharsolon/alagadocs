Your task is to ONLY extract medication information from the provided transcription. Do not generate patient or prescriber information as these will be filled in by the system.

Format the provided transcription and extract ONLY medication details with these requirements:

For EACH medication mentioned (there might be multiple medications):
- IMPORTANT: Always separate Generic Name and Brand Name into separate fields. If a medication is mentioned as "Generic (Brand)", extract them separately.
- Extract Medication Name (generic name only)
- Extract Brand Name if mentioned (usually in parentheses)
- Extract Strength (dosage amount like "80 mg", "500 mg")
- Identify Dosage Form (tablets, capsules, etc.)
- Convert instructions into clear medical terminology (Sig)
- Extract Quantity information
- Identify any Refills mentioned
- Note any Special Instructions

      "quantity": "string",
      "refills": "string",
      "specialInstructions": "string"
    }
  ]
}

- Each medication should be a separate object in the medications array
- If multiple medications are mentioned, list each one as a separate object
- ALWAYS separate generic name and brand name into their own fields - do not combine them
- For medications mentioned like "Aspirin (Aspilets) 80 mg", put "Aspirin" in genericName, "Aspilets" in brandName, and "80 mg" in strength
- Extract all relevant medication information from the transcription
- If certain medication details are not present, use "Not specified" as the value
- Convert patient descriptions into proper medical terminology
- Be accurate, concise, and follow standard medical writing practices
- CRITICAL: DO NOT INVENT INFORMATION. If the input doesn't mention medications, return an empty array.
- Ensure medications mentioned are available in the Philippines.`;
